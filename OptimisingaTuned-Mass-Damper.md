# Optimising a Tuned-Mass-Damper (TMD) for a Pedestrian Suspension Bridge Deck

When several people walk in step, the horizontal forcing is nearly sinusoidal at $\approx 1.6\,\text{–}\,2.2\ \text{Hz}$ (the cadence of human walking). If the bridge’s first lateral natural frequency sits in this band, resonance can produce deck accelerations that feel unsafe or even cause panic (Millennium Bridge,London,2000)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g37pKBl3DfE].

A a smaller “parasitic” mass connected to the deck by a spring and dashpot that absorbs energy near resonance and returns it as heat. Choosing its parameters (mass ratio, stiffness, damping) is a textbook application of forced, damped, coupled oscillations and normal-mode theory.

Light steel footbridges often have a first lateral natural frequency close to the cadence of walking crowds ($\approx 1.6\,\text{–}\,2.2\ \text{Hz}$). Synchronised pedestrians can excite a sinusoidal horizontal force that makes the deck vibrate uncomfortably. A Tuned-Mass Damper (TMD), a small secondary mass connected by a spring-dashpot, re-distributes the vibratory energy and keeps accelerations within the ISO 10137 lateral comfort limit of:
$0.2\ \text{m}\ \text{s}^{-2}$
